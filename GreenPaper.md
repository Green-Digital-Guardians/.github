## 1.	Gratitude Message
We want to give thanks to life, thanks for this new day, thanks to the source or energy *"God"*, but especially we want to give thanks to nature, thanks to the forests, thanks to the mountains, thanks to the trees, thanks to the air, thanks to the water, thanks to the seas, thanks to the animals, thanks to the flowers, a thousand and a thousand thanks for so much magnificence and love that they give us towards us *"Humans”*.

## 2.	¿What are the Green Arks of the Planet?
The Green Arks of the Planet are Green Lands or Properties where multiple ecosystems are found, such as:
- **Terrestrial ecosystems:** Jungles, Forests, Paramos, Bushes.
- **Aquatic Ecosystems:** Rivers, Seas, Reefs, Lakes, Lagoons, Springs.
- **Mixed Ecosystems:** Coasts and Wetlands.

These properties or Green Lands, from this moment on, we will call or denominate ***“GREEN ARKS”***.

The ***"GREEN ARKS”*** They are often refuges for numerous species of animals and plants that are in danger of extinction. That is enough to consider them important. In addition, they represent the preservation of a very important biological heritage from a scientific and even cultural point of view, in the struggle to sustain the biodiversity of our planet.

Appreciating and enjoying an ecosystem, feeling its smell, appreciating its nature, listening to the sound and silence of its own ecosystem, observing the animals, its insects and wild birds, are connections and sensations that the human being will not be able to forget.

The forests give a feeling of cleanliness and freshness, their ability to provide shade and retain moisture make them unique places of biodiversity and balance of the different kingdoms of life *(flora, fauna, fungi, protists and moneran)*.

In conclusion, the ***“GREEN ARKS”*** are true treasures of humanity that we must protect and defend from that dark power that day by day destroys and allows the felling of forests, the destruction of births, the destruction of thousands of habitats and ecosystems.

In the very near future those ***“GREEN ARKS”*** will serve as ***“Shelters for Life”*** <sub>even the human?</sub> They will be Green Lands for contemplation, for the enjoyment and use of all ***"DGGUARDIANS”*** becoming the first Decentralized Model of Environmental Protection, Solidarity, Visionary, Protectionist, and Democratic; model that will be referenced throughout Planet Earth.

## 3.	Destruction of the Green Arks of the Planet

For several decades, we have been hearing how Planet Earth and the environment have been destroyed by human beings, either directly or indirectly. We are all responsible and contribute to the destruction of the Planet.

Thousands of scientists and environmental organizations warn and warn about the serious situation in which planet earth finds itself, they even show us *"colors"* and *"clocks"* so that we understand and measure that we do not have much time left for action. We already understood that the responsibility for the protection and care of the Green Lands was left "big" to the State and therefore to its rulers.

We who are in this **COMMUNITY** have understood something, and that is that we are Environmental Guardians, we love the Mountains, the forests, the Rivers, the Water Sources, rather, que chimba the ***"PACHA MAMA"**.

So much arrogance and contempt for Planet Earth could not have the States and their Governors as the only responsible; we just have to understand what our origin is as ***"HUMANITY"***. What our role on earth, and if finally we are going to protect and defend it no matter where in the world you find or are. Or if instead you sat back and told future generations that we were not able to protect and defend it?

Scientists have already exposed the worst alerts of *"colors"* and even *"clocks"*; it is only a matter of time, the *"Time Has Come"*. They look like headlines from the worst destruction movie on the planet.

The main cause of biodiversity loss is the destruction of “Green Lands”. These Green Lands are full of Forests, Paramos, Jungles, Water Sources, Flora and Fauna, this is a true silent extermination, and *"justified"* to carry out agriculture, livestock, mining, construction of urban projects, construction of roads, construction of new industries, in short for the *“advancement of society”*.
 
All this destruction is generating the increase or decrease in the global temperature of the planet, more environmental pollution, extinction of thousands of living animal and plant species *(domino effect)*, devastation that we have been hearing through all the media and by the different government entities. who in their studies and research tell us about the multiple causes, consequences and effects of self-destruction of the human race itself.

The time has come to act, and we become ***GREEN DIGITAL GUARDIAN OF THE GREEN ARKS OF THE PLANET***. Que chimba la ***"PACHA MAMA"***.

## 4.	Ineffectiveness of the States in the Protection and Care of the Green Arks of the Planet

Today, the States and their rulers in the world already have all the legal tools *(organizations, agencies, regulations, resolutions, commissions, codes, laws, etc.)* to exercise true environmental protection of the natural resources of planet earth.

We naively think that the States and their rulers with all these legal weapons would be the new **GUARDIANS** of the **GREEN ARKS** of Planet Earth, a situation that in reality or in practice does not work like that.

Millions of Territories and Green Lands are being razed and destroyed with the complicity of state agents. The State never assumed the role of true Protector or **GUARDIAN** of natural resources, and its various excuses such as We are not competent, we have to wait for a ruling, there is no budget, the environmental norm does not grant these powers.

Faced with the lack of courage and courage of the States to fight for Planet Earth, faced with the accelerated and planned destruction of all natural resources, we constitute the ***“GREEN DIGITAL GUARDIANS OF THE GREEN ARKS OF PLANET EARTH”***.

## 5.	The Protection of the Green Arks is a Commitment of All. It's now or never

We always thought that the protection and defense of Planet Earth was solely and exclusively of the State and its Governors, what a great mistake. We have understood and heeded that the call to defend Planet Earth corresponds to all human beings, *"awakened or not awakened"* this is a matter of survival of the human race, it is a love story that does not want to end in ruins, it is just telling a story and the birth of a Peaceful and Organized community of Human Beings who were able to save Millions of Green Arks of Planet Earth from almost guaranteed destruction.

The time to act is *"now"*, and we only need your commitment and love for nature, for the mountains, for the jungles, for the forests, for the moors, for the rivers, for the seas, for the reefs, for the water births, THAT'S why I want to become a **DGGUARDIAN**.

The **DGGUARDIANS** will protect shelters for life *(humanity)*, we want to prevent **GREEN ARKS** continue to be razed and destroyed.

- The **GREEN ARKS** will be refuges of oxygen and natural water
- The **GREEN ARKS** will be refuges for wild animals.
- The **GREEN ARKS** will be refuges for fauna and flora.

The **GREEN ARKS** will become places of connection between the human being and the land, *“going back to the origin”*, protecting these rural lands for healthy spiritual spaces. 

## 6.	Our purpose is to create the Largest Community on Planet Earth "Digital Guardians of The Green Arks" through new NFT technologies

Our purpose is to create the community of ***GREEN DIGITAL GUARDIANS OF THE GREEN ARKS OF PLANET EARTH***, where new technologies such as Blockchain and NTFs will allow laying the foundations for a decentralized model of environmental protection, supportive, visionary, and democratic.

Our greatest strength and delight will be the millions of **DGGUARDIANS** who will be able to monitor and protect the **GREEN ARKS**.

Blockchain and NFT technology will allow in the future that all members of the community **DGGUARDIANS** may participate in the decisions and deliberations that involve the **GREEN ARKS**.

The economic resources will be allocated to objective tasks for the creation and strengthening of the community of **DGGUARDIANS** and to the protection of **GREEN ARKS**:

-	Acquisition and transfer as a donation to the foundation of the land to be protected.
-	Acquisition and purchase of materials to make enclosures of the **GREEN ARKS**, in order to inform third parties that the property or **GREEN ARK** enjoys global protection from **DGGUARDIANS**.
-	Acquisition and installation of the closed surveillance system through high-tech cameras, alarms and alerts connected to the monitoring and surveillance platform of the **DGGUARDIANS**.
-	Acquisition and installation of energy *(preferably renewable)* for the operation of the equipment.
-	Acquisition, purchase and maintenance of satellite internet systems for the operation of surveillance and monitoring equipment.
-	Acquisition of private security services in the area of the **GREEN ARK** protected

## 9.	First ***"GREEN ARK”*** called the ***"The promised land"*** Property located in a country called Colombia, Antioquia Department, El Carmen de Viboral Municipality, Location Chaverras

This **GREEN ARK** like most of the green lands and forests, they are located in areas far from the *“municipal or provincial”* urban centers. This property is located approximately twenty (20) kilometers from the urban center of the Municipality of Carmen de Viboral – Antioquia.

This property that we will protect **“DGGUARDIANS”** It has an approximate area of twenty (20) blocks or fifteen (15) hectares, surrounded by forests and native trees, streams with natural Jacuzzis, water springs, a great diversity of birds and birds; beautiful species of wild orchids.

The property is bordered by a beautiful natural river, known as *"Rio Cocorná"*.
   

This **GREEN ARK**, we will call it the **"Promised land"**

This **GREEN ARK** or **“Promised Land”** was given to a group of friends who love Nature, in order to use and enjoy it and that, in return, we carry out all the acts of care, protection and conservation of this beautiful **"Green Land"**. We live in the city of Medellin, and we are almost two hours from this beautiful **GREEN ARK**. Because of our jobs and occupations, we cannot be in the **"Promised Land"** every day carrying out acts of vigilance, care and conservation.

In the month of July 2022 we received a call from a peasant friend who lives near the **GREEN ARK** or **"Promised Land"**, and informed and alerted us that some lumberjacks were cutting down and felling native trees on the property to later sell the wood for crops. As we told you, due to our jobs located in the city of Medellin, we could not move immediately to the **"Promised Land"**, we could only go until next weekend, *(5 days after the alert call)* in order verify and verify if the information was real or not. When on Saturday we arrived at the **GREEN ARK** We were able to observe that, if they had entered the **"Promised Land"** illegally, and if they were effectively destroying the native forest *(flora and fauna)* forest that feeds all the water sources of the **"GREEN ARK”**.

We entered the trails or paths made by illegal loggers and we found devastation and destruction of the native forest, serious damage to the flora and fauna of the **"Promised Land"**, thousands of trees destroyed on the ground, to be converted into *"sticks"* for bean or tree tomato crops. In case it is worth destroying our forests, we stop mountains to obtain such a poor economic benefit.

An inventory of the native tree species that were razed and destroyed was made, and we found these:

Niguito *(Miconia jahnii)*, Sietecueros *(Andesanthus lepidotus)*, Cargagua *(Clethra revoluta)*, Carate *(Vismia baccifera)*, Spearhead *(Vismia guianensis)*, Espadero *(Myrsine coriacea)*, Niguito *(Miconia theizans)*, Wax olive tree *(Morella pubescens)*, Arrayan *(Myrcia popayanensis)*, Sauco de monte *(Viburnum undulatum)*, Aguadulce *(Palicourea sp.)*, among others.

Finding no loggers or illegal trespassers, we wanted to place a "warning or prohibition" notice at the entrance to the **"Promised Land"** in order to inform third parties that the **"Promised Land"** was an environmental reserve and was protected. For the state. Thus we think the destructive actions of logging of the native forest could cease. That same day we made geographical locations of the property or "Promised Land", we also took photographs of the environmental damage caused by these illegal loggers, in order to obtain some proof of the serious environmental damage that had occurred. Our idea was to inform all local and departmental authorities so that they could investigate, individualize, and identify the environmental aggressors and thus, enforce the forests and **GREEN ARKS** of humanity.

Unfortunately, this was not the case. On Tuesday, we received another call to our cell phone from our friend and peasant from the area, and he informed us *"that the loggers were once again involved in taking out wood and loads to take them out at night in a cart."*

As the best story of Esperanza, we only asked for JUSTICE in the face of the serious environmental damage caused to the **"Promised Land"**, and we thought Thank you that today there are new regulations and laws for environmental protection. Today if there were state entities that protect the environment.! How naive we were to think that the State and its Governors would be the **"GUARDIANS of the Promised Land"**, what a great lie and disappointment we had in the protection of this **GREEN ARK**.
 
The following week, we received another call from our peasant friend who lives near the **GREEN ARK** or “Promised Land” and alerts us again that the loggers were in the **"Promised Land"** destroying the native forest, and that no police or environmental authority had come down there to stop that environmental massacre. Immediately I felt a lump in my throat and impotence of not being able to move immediately to defend the Promised Land, absurd limitations of work type and compliance with schedules.
 
We immediately picked up the phone to communicate with all the authorities *(mayor's office, police inspectorate, corregiduría, Cornare environmental entity, etc.)* to tell them and report that in the **"Promised land"** An environmental massacre was taking place by some illegal loggers who had been destroying native forest for several days. We informed them that they were destroying the native forest and thus destroying all the water springs on the property or **GREEN ARK** and that, given the seriousness of the facts denounced, we required the assistance and immediate presence of the authorities in the **"Promised Land"**.

The response of *"ALL Public Servants"* was that they could not go to the **"Promised Land"** until a written and formal environmental complaint was filed, with all the facts and evidence, and that we tried to provide the names and identity cards. of those responsible or illegal loggers.

After filing the environmental complaint, we had to wait a few days until the "distribution of the environmental complaint" was made. As if the forests and trees in danger and threat could wait so as not to be destroyed or cut down, *"every second counts."*

Then a public official contacted us so that we could tell him what was happening, and he told us that unfortunately we were the ones who had to go down to the "Promised Land" and defend it, since the *"environmental public entity"* did not even have a group special or elite force of immediate reaction to deal with the threats and destruction of green lands.

For more than 70 years we have been talking about climate change, we are talking about thousands of advances in environmental and legal matters, we are talking about the Paris Agreement, the formation of new state entities, the holding of important meetings of heads of state, the holding of congresses, conferences, reports, studies, protocols, all of them informing us of the same causes and warning of the bad course in which Planet Earth is headed.

When we understand that we are all the problem and that we can all be the solution at the same time, real and profound changes originate, and that they can be built and originated from the **COMMUNITY** of **“DGGUARDIANS”**.

The **STATE** is not interested in the **PROTECTION OF GREEN LANDS**, **“GREEN ARKS”** of the planet, they are not interested in assuming the role of **“GUARDIANS”** of a land that has no voice, and that the only thing it expects from human beings is their defense and protection.	 

With this motherfucking frustration and indifference against nature, it came to our minds how we could care for and protect the **GREEN ARKS OF THE PLANET**, and that is how we started this **GENESIS ONE** of the **PROMISED LAND**

Our intention is to consolidate the largest **COMMUNITY** on planet Earth called ***“GREEN DIGITAL GUARDIANS OF THE GREEN ARKS OF PLANET EARTH” – DGGUARDIANS*** having requirements such as unique but very special income requirements:

1. “DEEPLY LOVE NATURE”
2. “DEFEND IT AND PROTECT IT”

Regardless of which city in the world you are in, you will be able to watch over and defend the **"Promised land"** through an integrated system of surveillance and monitoring cameras, an alert and sound system, an alert system and protocols, and solutions that all members of the DGGUARDIANS COMMUNITY.
